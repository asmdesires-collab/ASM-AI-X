## Scope & Security Model

ASM-AI-X is a governance-first AGI reference architecture.
This repository contains **architectural specifications and governance frameworks**, not executable code.

Security in ASM-AI-X is treated as a **system-level property**, enforced through:
- architectural invariants,
- governance constraints,
- responsible disclosure principles.

## Supported Versions

ASM-AI-X follows a **canonical versioning model** focused on architectural stability rather than software releases.
