# Security Policy

## Scope & Security Model

ASM-AI-X is a governance-first AGI reference architecture.
This repository contains **architectural specifications and governance frameworks**, not executable code.

Security in ASM-AI-X is treated as a **system-level property**, enforced through:
- architectural invariants,
- governance constraints,
- responsible disclosure principles.

---

## Supported Versions

ASM-AI-X follows a **canonical versioning model** focused on architectural stability rather than software releases.

| Edition / Version | Supported | Notes |
|------------------|-----------|-------|
| Canon v1.x (Public) | ✅ Yes | Current public reference architecture |
| Draft / Pre-Canon | ❌ No | Not supported |
| Deprecated versions | ❌ No | Deprecated versions are not supported; contact maintainers for migration guidance |

## Reporting a Security Issue
